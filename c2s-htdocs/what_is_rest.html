      <h1>What is REST?</h1>
      
        REST stands for <i>REpresentational State Transfer</i>.
        Besides SOAP or other specifications, REST provides a new way to implement web services.
        It is the result of the dissertation of Roy Fielding (University of California, 2000) and is based on a set of principles that are already known from the world wide web.
        
        <br />
        <br />
        
        A REST service architecture is based on the HTTP protocol but to be a REST service it has to follow a set of rules: 

      <h3>Stateless communication</h3>
        A REST request is self-contained.
        This means that neither the client nor the server needs to store information between requests.
        It does <b>not</b> mean that a REST resource or client cannot have a state, but the state will be either turned into resource state, or kept on the client.
        
      <h3>Addressability</h3>
        Each resource provided by a REST service has a unique address (the URI).
        A URI is the way to identify resources in the web.
        It allows the user to easily remark resources by simply storing the according URI (creating a bookmark or whatever).
        URIs are supposed to have a directory-like structure so that they can be used intuitively.
        
      <h3>Various representations</h3>
        According to the request, a REST web service should be able to provide a various number of representations of a resource.
        The information which representation to choose is to be done by the client and sent with the request.
        A web browser for instance can handle (display) data from all resources that produce html.
        
      <h3>Methods</h3>
        REST defines the standard methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD and OPTIONS to be implemented for each resource.
        The explicit usage of these methods is one of the key characteristics.
        
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>GET:</td>
            <td>Request a resource from the server. A GET request is defined to be a safe operation. This means that a GET request causes no side effects on the server.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>POST:</td>
            <td>
              Create a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI.
              The URI of the created subordinate is delivered as result back to the client. 
              An example could be posting a new message to a mailing-list, forum or whatever.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>PUT:</td>
            <td>Store the enclosed entity under the supplied request URI or, if already existing, modify the resource.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>DELETE:</td>
            <td>Delete the resource under the supplied URI.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>HEAD:</td>
            <td>Request metadata for the resource under the supplied URI.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>OPTIONS:</td>
            <td>Request avaiable methods of a resource.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        
      <h3>Hypermedia</h3>
        Link things together so that a simple navigation between resources of a web service is realized.
        The client should be able to move from one state of a service to the next.
