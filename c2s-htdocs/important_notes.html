      <h2>Important Notes</h2>
      
      C2Serve is in beta phase. This means that there may be still some unknown bugs and memory issues.
      The interface of some basic classes and functions will change in all likelihood.
      Windows is currently not supported, only UNIX systems.
      Furthermore, the documentation currently only explains the basics of C2Serve.
      A more detailed explanation is planned by the end of 2011.

      To figure out how C2Serve works you can start with the example in directory <code>c2s-example</code>.
      This example shows how to create REST resources and methods and start the socket listener.
      A more detailed look into C2Serve is provided by the tests in <code>c2s-test</code>, especially <code>c2s-test/rest</code>.
      The following section also explains the basic steps to create a web service using C2Serve.
