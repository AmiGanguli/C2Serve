	    <h1>Download and Installation</h1>
	  
	    Download the <a href="https://github.com/c2s/C2Serve/zipball/master">source distribution</a> and unpack the archive.
	    Alternatively, you can also clone the repository by running <code>git clone git@github.com:c2s/C2Serve.git</code>.
	    The directory which contains the build and source will be referred in the following as <code>C2S_ROOT_DIR</code>.
	    
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    
	    The build is realized using <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>, so you will need <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> installed on your build machine.
	    Open a terminal and create a build directory.
	    <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> will need it to create its build environment and to build the binaries there.
	    
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    
	    Next step is to create the build environment.
	    Change into the build directory and run <code>cmake C2S_ROOT_DIR</code>.
	    By default, the libraries, headers and test executables are built into a created <code>install</code> directory within the build directory.
	    You can specify another directory by defining the install prefix: <code>cmake -DINSTALL_PREFIX=MY_INSTALL_DIR</code>.
	    
	    <br />
      <br />
      
      Now you can build the binaries by running <code>make install</code>.
      The libraries are built into a <code>lib</code> directory which is created in the <code>install</code> directory.
      To build the unit tests, you have to install the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost libraries</a> or specify the Boost root directory when initializing the build environment: <code>-DBOOST_ROOT=MY_BOOST_ROOT_DIR</code>.
	    
	    <br />
	    <br />
	    
	    If you are using <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> in your project, you can also easily add the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> in the C2Serve root directory to your build system:
	    
	    <div class="code">
		    <code class="cmake-lists">
		       set( DISABLE_C2S_SYSTEM_SETTINGS ON ) <br />
		       add_subdirectory( C2S_ROOT_DIR )
		    </code>
	    </div>
    
	    First of all you should disable the C2Serve system scripts.
	    Afterwards you can add the <code>C2S_ROOT_DIR</code> to your build paths.
	    If this directory is placed outside of your source tree, <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> needs a binary directory defined to know where to build the binaries.
	    Check the <a href="http://cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake-2-8-docs.html">CMake documendation</a> for more information.
